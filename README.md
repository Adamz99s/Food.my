**System Requirements and Setup Guide**

This guide outlines the necessary steps to set up a system that utilizes Visual Studio Code, Laravel, XAMPP, Composer, and Spatie. These tools are essential for developing web applications using the Laravel framework. Please follow the instructions provided below to ensure a smooth setup process.

### 1. Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. To install Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

- Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Download the installer suitable for your operating system.
- Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

### 2. Laravel
Laravel is a PHP web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. To install Laravel, you need to have PHP and Composer installed on your system. Follow these steps:

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Install Composer by following the instructions on the [official Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
- Once Composer is installed, you can install Laravel by running the following command:
  ```
  composer global require laravel/installer
  ```
- After installation, make sure to add Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory to your system's $PATH to access the Laravel executable globally.

### 3. XAMPP
XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends. It consists mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. To install XAMPP:

- Visit the [XAMPP website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
- Download the installer suitable for your operating system.
- Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

### 4. Composer
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. To install Composer:

- Visit the [official Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
- Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system.

### 5. Spatie
Spatie is a popular PHP package development company. They provide various useful packages that can be integrated into Laravel applications. To integrate Spatie packages into your Laravel application:

- Open your Laravel project in Visual Studio Code.
- Edit your `composer.json` file to require the desired Spatie package. For example:
  ```json
  {
      "require": {
          "spatie/laravel-permission": "^5.0"
      }
  }
  ```
- Run `composer update` to install the package and its dependencies.
- Follow the specific instructions provided by the Spatie package documentation for further configuration and usage.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for each of the mentioned tools.
- It's recommended to regularly update your dependencies to benefit from the latest features and security patches.
- Refer to the official documentation of each tool for more detailed information and troubleshooting tips.

Following these steps should enable you to set up a development environment using Visual Studio Code, Laravel, XAMPP, Composer, and Spatie efficiently. If you encounter any issues during the setup process, don't hesitate to consult the respective documentation or seek assistance from the developer community.

### 6. Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. Some Laravel applications may require Node.js for front-end build processes or other functionalities.

To install Node.js and npm and integrate them with Laravel, follow the steps below:

1. Download Node.js and npm: Visit the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)) and download the installer based on your OS. This will install both Node.js and npm. You can check the successful installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
2. After successfully installing Node.js and npm, navigate to your Laravel project directory.
3. You need to install the necessary Laravel Mix dependencies. Laravel Mix provides a clean, fluent API for defining basic webpack build steps for your Laravel application. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
4. Now, you can compile your assets using Laravel Mix. Run `npm run dev` in your terminal. This command will compile your assets for development.
5. Start the Laravel server by running `php artisan serve` in your terminal. This command will start the Laravel development server.
6. Open your browser and visit the application url (usually [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)) to see your Laravel application.

Remember to replace '8000' with the port number your server is running on if it's different.

### 7. Mysql
- Ensure you download .mysql file and insert it into 'PHPMyAdmin' in order to perform Login and Registration.
- File Availability can be received at Releases section.

### 8. (.env)
- Ensure that you change the (.envexample) to (.env) and rename its database content as (mysql) with (food.my) as database name.



### Additional Notes:
- Node.js may not be necessary for all Laravel projects, but it can be useful for applications with front-end requirements.
- Make sure to install Node.js and npm globally on your system to access them from the command line.
- Consult the Laravel documentation for more information on integrating Node.js and npm with your Laravel project.

With Node.js added to the setup, you should now have a comprehensive development environment ready for Laravel application development. If you encounter any issues or have questions about integrating Node.js with your Laravel project, refer to the documentation or seek assistance from the developer community.
